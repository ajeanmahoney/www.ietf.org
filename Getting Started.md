Welcome to the IETF!

We recommend that everyone who wants to get started with the IETF reads our **[Introduction to the IETF]()** as this succinctly covers the basics of what we are, who we are, what we do and how we do it.

Once you have a basic understanding of the IETF and  an idea how you would like to get involved, we recommend that you read one of the following guides:

* **[Guide to IETF Working Groups]()**. This explains what a working group is, how to participate and how Working Groups operate.  As almost all of the work of the IETF takes place in Working Groups, this is key reading for anyone who wishes to participate in the IETF.

* **[Guide to IETF Meetings]()**. This is a full guide to IETF Meetings, ideally suited for those planning to attend a meeting for the first time, but also a useful reference for those who are still unfamiliar with certain aspects.

* **[Guide to bringing new work to the IETF]()**. This is particulalry aimed at people who have a new idea or proposed work that they want to bring to the IETF.
