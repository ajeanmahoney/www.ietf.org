The work of the IETF is to produce technical documents that define how Internet technology works in detail, and can be operated and managed at scale.

New work in the IETF begins with one or more participants producing a discussion document called an Internet-Draft (I-D) and then working to get that I-D adopted for further work. Anyone can write an Internet-Draft on any topic they believe is relevant to the IETF. There are different routes that an I-D can follow to be adopted, worked on and eventually become an RFC.

The IETF has [policies](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8179.html) about Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) that apply when submitting I-Ds and when making other contributions to the IETF, such as by participating on mailing lists. They are designed to ensure that IETF participants have as much information as possible about any IPR constraints on a technical proposal as early as possible in the development process.

The vast majority of the IETF's work is done in its many [Working Groups](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/). A Working Group (WG) has its own mailing list with most of its interaction, and all of it official work, conducted via email. A WG also has a charter that states the scope of discussion for the WG and its goals. The WG's mailing list and any WG meetings are expected to focus only on what is in the charter. A WG is headed by several **WG chairs**.

Working Groups are organized into several areas, Application and Real Time (art), General (gen), Internet (int), Operations and Management (ops), Routing (rtg), Security (sec), and Transport (tsv), with each area overseen by several **Area Directors** (AD).

The day to day work of WGs revolves around Internet-Drafts, those that have been proposed for adoption and those that have been adopted, and over time the WG shapes the latter into RFCs. Decisions within WGs, as with the broader IETF, are taken by 'rough consensus' and not by voting. One responsibility of the role of the WG chairs is to determine when rough consensus has been reached.  When a Working Group has finished with an I-D and is ready for it to become an RFC, the I-D goes through a process to ensure that it has approval from the appointed technical leadership and the consensus support of the IETF as a whole. 

The other routes for an I-D to become an RFC are as the output of some of the leadership bodies, Area Directors can sponsor an I-D, and there is an independent submissions process. 

When an I-D has cleared all the hurdles to become an RFC it goes through a professional editorial process and is then assigned a number, published in a range of formats, both human- and machine-readable, and deposited in libraries and archives.
