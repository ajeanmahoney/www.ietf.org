This repository contains the authoritative content of key pages from www.ietf.org in order to allow the community to send PRs for that content.

# Types of content
These are the types of content that we are working on in this repository:

| Type | Description | Audience |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Summary | A very short piece (generally no more than 1500 words) that tells people that the subject exists | General public |
| Introduction | Several paragraphs that very briefly explains the key points about a subject | Potential participants | 
| Guide | Detailed piece that provides the details of a subject but does not include any arcana or details that are only relevant to a small subset of readers | Participants|

# Published content
The following have all been published. For now, that is a manual process whereby the content is pasted into the website CMS, but it is hoped that this will be automated in future.  Unless stated otherwise, you are free to submit a PR on any of this content.

* **Introduction to the IETF**. This is a complete [page](https://www.ietf.org/about/introduction/).  By necessity, this page has content in it that is repeated elsewhere, but excessive detail should be avoided.
* **Guide to IETF Meetings**. This is a complete [ page](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/introduction-to-ietf-meetings/).  It is written largely for those new to IETF meetings and is intentionally a long read.  Some elements are intentionally just brief references to other pages (e.g. Meeting Technology, Support for New Participants).
* **Support for new participants**. This content is used as a [section](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/new-participants/) of a page with the rest of that page including specific information about the upcoming IETF meeting.

# Working content
The following are all being worked on and may change or be reorganised at any point.

* **Introduction to Tools and Services**. This is largely complete and just waiting for a change to the menu structure so that it can be published.
* **Introduction to the structure of the IETF**.  This is largely complete but before it can be published, significant clearing up of the existing groups content is needed. May turn into a Guide.
* **Introduction to the work of the IETF**. This is a collection of relevant text, drawn from multiple sources, still to be organised. This is likely to lead to one or more Guides to the work.
* **Culture and Folklore of the IETF**. This is a collection of relevant text, drawn from multiple sources, still to be organised.
* **RFCs**. This is a collection of relevant text, drawn from multiple sources, lots of it.  No decision has been made on how to pitch this - either as an introduction, or a comprehensive guide.  Some (much?) of this text may be better on the [RFC Editor site](https://www.rfc-editor.org)

# Relationship to the Tao of the IETF
The Tao has now evolved into the new set of documents above, which are in many cases largely drawn from Tao content and covering the same subject matter, though written differently.  

# Content style guide

Please refer to the [styleguide](styleguide.md) for guidance about text.
 
The following general guidance is applied to this content. 

1.  Give coverage only to what really matters without going into details on everything, even if that means leaving some things unexplained or only vaguely touched on. More detail can come in a more specific document. Controlling repetition across the whole website is crucial.

2.  While some of this content is aimed specifically at those new to the IETF, avoid constantly declaring that as it actually puts people off by labelling them and boxing them into a pre-defined role.  Better just to tell people the facts and let them decide how they fit in.

3.  Wherever possible say "this is what X is" rather than the old Tao approach of "you might think X is … but no it’s actually … !!".

4.  Move almost all of the side remarks, insights into culture, memes, etc into the separate document on Culture and Folklore, while still trying to capture the intent where needed.  It’s not that they’re without value, it’s just that they have a time and a place where they are most effective and that is when someone is already somewhat familiar with the IETF and can use those to consolidate their mental model, but not for newcomers.

5.  Limit the number of external references.  There’s a balance between referencing sources and providing additional information, and distracting people from the current document.
