# <a id="many-people">It takes many people with many different views to build a resilient protocol</a>
The IETF has, for decades, successfully produced protocols that are resilient and performant at Internet scale and the core reason for this is because each protocol has been built by the combined efforts of many people with many different views scrutinising every aspect of the design. To be effective in the IETF it is essential that you recognise this and embrace that way of working. This means:
* Do not try to "own" any idea, however small.  Ideas brought to the IETF do not belong to individuals and may change shape beyond all recognition from conception to completion. 
* When somebody raises a point that you do not think is relevant, or do not think is important enough to address, try hard to see if you can adjust your own desired outcome to incorporate this point. Your aim should not be to get the outcome that you want, but an outcome that you can live with.  This is key to reaching consensus. 

# <a id="asynchronous-process">The IETF is rarely realtime, it is mainly slow and asynchronous</a>
The IETF is a global organisation and therefore cannot operate in realtime with its participants spread across so many different timezones. Added to this, most IETF participants are volunteers with other responsibilities to balance. This can lead to a latency of days between messages.

With that in mind, it is important not to fall into the trap of working as if the IETF is realtime:
* Do not feel obliged to reply quickly to a point, take your time to think it through. It is often useful to write drafts responses and work on those over a day or two rather than send them immediately.  
* Be careful when sending multiple replies - it can be overwheming for someone who only looks at their email every other day if they are presented with hundreds of messages.

WG sessions at IETF meetings (and interim meetings) are a crucial way of short-circuiting this long asynchronous process as they enable a lot of issues to be discussed in a very short session. There are many examples of long and protracted discussions on a mailing list being resolved in minutes when all the participants are able to get together in realtime.

All WG sessions at IETF meeting (or interim meetings) have public video archives and it is often worth watching those to get up to speed on a particular WG.

# <a id="email">Use email in a specific, structured way</a>
Email is a tool that can be used in many different ways, and in the IETF there is a particular way that is the most productive and the most effective. This is not about netiquette or some old-fashioned idea of how email should be used - this is a specific method that uses email very similarly to issue trackers (e.g. GitHub) and thereby makes it as easy as possible for other readers to follow and later reference.

Remember, nobody is required to read your emails, not even document authors or WG chairs, and reading email is time-consuming and takes mental effort.  The more you can do to structure your emails to mimimise the time and effort required by other readers, the more effective your emails will be.

The key points here are:
1. Change the subject line when the subject changes.  Many people feel it is somehow rude or presumptuous to change the subject line of a thread, but it is not, it is a necessary discipline so that readers know what the emails are about.
2. When you have something new to say, start a new thread. You do not need any permission to do so. This can be done by replying to an existing thread with a new subject line, but often it's cleaner to send a new email that is not a reply, with a new subject. Seperate threads are much easier for people to read and refer to later. 
3. Keep it short and to the point. The more text you write, the more likely that some people will skim read it and miss important nuances, or not even read it at all.
4. Reply to individual points individually, after the quoted text of that point. This allows the reader to immediately understand the context of your reply and makes your reply much more effective, particularly if you want the reader to act on it.
5. When you reply, cut down the quoted text that you are replying to, to the minimum required to provide the context for your reply. It is not rude to remove 99% of someone's message and just quote the sentence/phrase that you want to reply to.  This focuses the conversation and ensures that other readers do not waste time re-reading unnecessary text.
6. It is fine to reply to multiple people in one response, if the points they have made are sufficiently related that this is needed. All you need do is quote one person and add your reply, and then quote the next person and reply.

As an example, if someone writes:

> I think we should add X to this because
> 1. Reason A. _[Brief introduction followed by lots of explanation]_
> 2. Reason B. _[Brief introduction followed by lots of explanation]_
> 3. Reason C. _[Brief introduction followed by lots of explanation]_

If you want to say something about reasons A and C you should reply as follows (note the editing of the quoted text):

>> I think we should add X to this because
>> 1. Reason A. _[Only quote the brief introduction, remove the rest]_
>
> Your reply to reason A goes here.
>> 3. Reason C. _[Only quote the brief introduction, remove the rest]_
>
> Your reply to reason C goes here

Some things to avoid are:
1. If you write emails at the top of the message that cover multiple points, then many people will simply not take it all in and others will not read more than the first few lines.  
2. If you write incredibly long emails without breaking them up with headings and other structure then people will either skim read them, just read the first few lines, or not even read them at all.  There are times when you might need to write a very long email, in which case use structure to help people read them - headings, bullets, introductions, summaries, etc. Alternatively, consider if this is better as an Internet-Draft.  
3. It is common in business email for people to just press reply and write something at the top, keeping a copy of every previous reply in the message below. In the IETF context this is a real problem for two reasons: the first is that some participants use email clients that do not hide quoted text very well and the second is that every message appears in the public archive, and that clutters this archive reducing its utility as a reference tool. 

(Note: You will see some people write long rambling emails and others then reply to them, but this hides the fact that very few people will have bothered to read the full email).

# <a id="read-thoroughly">Read the relevant Internet-Drafts, related RFCs and archives, thoroughly</a>
Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) are the core mechanism for IETF participant to share ideas. These often refer to RFCs or other I-Ds by way of background. If you want to fully participate in any discussion in the IETF then you will need to read the I-Ds related to that discussion and any RFCs or other documents that they refer to. Each WG has a page that lists the finished RFCs and adopted I-Ds, and unadopted relevant I-Ds are notified to the mailing list by the authors. 

All IETF mailing lists have a public archive and there are many times when it is important to read the list archive in orded to participate effectively. These include:
* If you want to raise something and have a suspicion that this might have been raised before.
* If you think you may have missed some important context.
* If people say that something has been raised before and that's why they don't want to discuss it again. 

Altogether, this can mean a lot of reading, but if you do not do it then you will not have the necessary context to engage in the discussion. There is also the risk that this becomes obvious and others then choose not to listen to you.

# <a id="send-text">Send text</a>
The IETF works on proposed text and proposed changes to that text. It is so much better to say "I don't like this text because of X, and here is some alternative text that fixes that" because this turns your point into something actionable.

There are two other major benefit from sending text. The first is that it will help you focus your thoughts into clear and precise language that says what you want it to say. The second is that it helps people understand what you are saying, particularly because of the focus it brings, and what impact it will have. Every IETF participant will have come across a situation where a point only becomes clear when someone turns it into proposed text.

The importance of sending text cannot be overstated - this is possibly the most common reason that people feel rejected, because they make a good suggestion but don't propose text and nobody else does it for them. There are some circumstances when WGs expect document editors/authors to produce text to cover the points raised, but this is imperfect and can be missed, or the text may not be as you expect it.

# <a id="polite-engineer">Talk and listen like a polite engineer</a>
The IETF is an engineering organisation, where participants write/talk directly, often without regard for any niceties, and read/listen to what others say without looking for any niceties or hidden meaning. Provided this is within the IETF's clear expectations for participant behaviour, this should not be mis-interpreted as rudeness or impatience. 'Directness' can never be an excuse for inappropriate behaviour.

Of course, politeness helps with participant interaction and is positively encouraged.

Remember that email does not have the nuance of human speech. It is easy to misunderstand someone and to misattribute someone's tone or motivation. It is good practice to read the words as written, without assuming any tone or underlying intent. A good tip - when you are reading an email from another participant (or even when you are writing your own emails), imagine them being spoken in a slow, neutral, engineering tone, even if you know the author.
