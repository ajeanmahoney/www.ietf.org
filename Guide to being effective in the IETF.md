Once you have that working, simply read the mail threads daily, and read any draft documents that they refer to. (See the next section for hints on how to find particular drafts.) It's advisable to wait several weeks before starting to contribute to the mailing list. But when you feel comfortable that you have something new to say, go for it!

The IETF is normally very welcoming to newcomers, and tolerance is the rule. The technical level is quite high, so if you write something that turns out to be wrong, you may get some quite frank replies. Or sometimes you will get a reply from someone whose first language is not English, and they can be rude without intending it. (If someone is seriously offensive, the WG Chairs are supposed to deal with it.) Don't be discouraged; everybody started as a newcomer.

The collaborative process used to develop early RFCs remains an important part of the IETF spirit. 

In many ways, the IETF runs on the beliefs of its participants. One of the
founding beliefs is embodied in an early quote about the IETF from David
Clark: "We reject kings, presidents and voting. We believe in rough consensus
and running code." Another early quote that has become a commonly-held belief
in the IETF comes from Jon Postel: "Be conservative in what you send and
liberal in what you accept."

Work in the IETF is often reciprocal, contribute positively to others work and you are more likely to receive comments and feedback on your work.

My observation is that being effective at IETF means sending well written
emails: no HTML, no top-quoting, quotes well-edited.  Being able to respond
to multiple people/points in a single go, and also being able to see the
thread as a whole, rather than just reacting.
All the really effective people turned off the "You have mail" pop-up along time ago.

It is, I think, a bit like the idea that every Padawan in Star Wars is
expected to build their own light saber before they can graduate.

The willingness to invest some significant amount of time to get a good
working email system that can deal with IETF volumes of email is an
overlooked skill/investment.  At one point, it was a necessary thing to
learn, but today, many younger people don't even know enough SMTP to know
they could forge an email.  It might not be necessary anymore, but it might
be that it is still important.  I'm not bashing young people, but rather saying
that there is a rite of passage often undervalued and discouraged by current
desktop environments.  (SMTP is just FTP control port on speed, and soooo many
of our protocols inherit from that)
