The IETF has a self-organized structure of leadership groups, processes and policies, all drawn from the pool of volunteer participants. Anyone can put themselves forward for any leadership role and appointment is either by a nominating committee selected by random lot from eligible volunteers, or by one of the other leadership bodies. The IETF publishes most of its processes, policies and role specifications for its organizational structures as RFCs and BCPs.

The **Internet Engineering Steering Group** ([IESG](https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/)) has overall responsibility for the standards process and technical management of IETF activities. The IESG consists of the Area Directors and some advisory liaisons. The IESG, and the IETF as a whole, is chaired by the IETF Chair.

The **Internet Architecture Board** ([IAB](https://www.iab.org)) provides long-term technical direction for Internet architecture, and is responsible for external liaisons and some key leadership appointments.

The **Internet Research Task Force** ([IRTF](https://irtf.org)) focuses on longer-term research issues related to the Internet and works alongside the IETF through a number of Research Groups.

The [**IETF Trust**](https://trustee.ietf.org) is a supporting organization that owns and manages the intellectual property of the IETF, including rights assigned to it by the authors of Internet-Drafts.

The **Independent Submissions Editor** ([ISE](https://www.rfc-editor.org/about/independent/)) is an appointed volunteer participant who manages the independent submissions process, one of the paths for the publication of an RFC.

The **IETF Administration LLC** ([IETF LLC](https://www.ietf.org/about/administration/)) provides the corporate legal home for the IETF and organizes its administrative support. It is overseen by an appointed board of volunteer participants and has a small number of paid staff, including the **IETF Executive Director**, while contracting out key support services. IETF LLC staff and contractors have no influence over the technical content of Internet standards.

The **Internet Society** ([ISOC](https://www.internetsociety.org)) is an international, non-profit, membership organization that supports and promotes the development of the Internet as a global technical infrastructure. One of the ways that ISOC does this is through support of the IETF. The IETF LLC is a subsidiary of ISOC.
